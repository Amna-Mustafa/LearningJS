JAVASCRIPT â€“ Objects


1. Object Properties

-> Object properties are defined as a simple association between name and value.

var str = document.title;

2. Object Methods
An object is a collection of key/value pairs or properties. When the value is a function, the property becomes a method.
<script>
    // Create an object:
    const person = {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
      id: 5566,
      fullName : function() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
      }
    };
    
    // Display data from the object:
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.fullName();
    </script>
3. User-Defined Objects
    =- User-defined objects: these are objects which you have created in your program or application.
    <script>
        var employee = new Object();
        var books = new Array("C++", "Perl", "Java");
        var day = new Date("August 15, 1947");
    </script>
