What is javascript?

Javascript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.

Client-Side Javascript?

defer and async in javascript?

	•	If async is present: The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available (before parsing completes)
	•	If defer is present (and not async): The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing
	•	If neither async nor defer is present: The script is downloaded and executed immediately, blocking parsing until the script is completed
