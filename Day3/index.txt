JS-BASICS – Day3

1. What is an Event?

-> JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events. 
-> When the page loads, it is called an event. 
-> When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. 

HTML 5 Standard Events 

-> onblur,onchange,onkeyup,onload etc

2. Cookies

    Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.

    When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.

    Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":

    When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
    Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.
    Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:

    username = John Doe

3. Page Redirect 

    Redirect is nothing but a mechanism of send users on a different URL from the original one.

    Page Refresh

    In JavaScript, you refresh the page using document.location.reload().

    Page Redirection Works?

    If you move the site to a separate domain or create a new URL for an old page, you should always use the server redirection.
    location.href = 'new_url';

4.  Dialog Box 
    Alert Dialog Box 
        An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.
        window.alert("Success");

    Confirmation Dialog Box
        The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a message, an OK button, and a Cancel button.

        confirm("Press a button!\nEither OK or Cancel.");

    Prompt Dialog Box
        The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the user for input

        prompt("Enter your name", "John Doe");

5. Void Keyword

    When a function is void, it means that the function returns nothing. 

6.  Page Printing 

    To print a page in JavaScript, use the print() method. It opens up the standard dialog box.
