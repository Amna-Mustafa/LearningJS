// Regular Expression
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.

1. Brackets - We use []
let regex = /h[a-z]rry/; // can be any character from a to z
regex = /h[aty]rry/; // can be an a, t or y
regex = /h[^aty]rry/; // cannot be any of a, t or y
regex = /h[^aty]rr[yYu]/; // cannot be any of a, t or y + can be a u or y
regex = /h[a-zA-Z]rr[yu0-9][0-9]/; // we can have as many character sets as we want


2.  Quantifiers - We use {}
regex = /har{2}y/; // r can occur exactly 2 times
regex = /har{0,2}y/; // r can occur exactly 0 to 2 (0 or 1 or 2) times


3. Metacharacters symbols
let regex = /harrsdfgy/;
regex = /^harrdc/; // ^ means expression will match if string starts with
regex = /harry$/; // $ at the end of the string means "string ends with"
regex = /h.rry/; //matches any one character
regex = /h*rry/; //matches any 0 or more characters
regex = /ha?rryi?t/; //? after character means that character is optional
regex = /h\*rry/


4. Methods

    (i) exec():-
        This method will executes a search for a match in a string. It returns an array of information or null on a mismatch. Here is an example:
        let obj = /h/.exec("Code with harry");

    (ii) test():-
        This method tests for a match in a string. It returns true or false. Here is an example:
        let str = /Code/;
